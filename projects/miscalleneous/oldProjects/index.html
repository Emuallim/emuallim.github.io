        <h2>(1) PRODOS</h2>
        <p>
            July 2019 - Prodos is the very first website I built as the final project of "Thirty Days to Learn HTML and CSS". It might be ideal for small business owners or solo-entrepreneurs. No javascript was used to make this site. I used only HTML, CSS and a
            little bit of bootstrap.
        </p>
        <h2>(2) BBC CLONE</h2>
        <p>
            July 2019 - BBC clone is the second project that I built as a part of "The Complete Web Developer Course 2.0". I used only HTML and CSS to build this website. Although it needs a bit more css styling, it looks pretty real doesn't it?
        </p>
        <h2>(3) COMING SOON</h2>
        <p>
            September 2019 - This is another project that I built with the help of the "Practical Front-end Web Development - Learn With Projects" course. The page is fully responsive. It will soon be ready
        </p>
        <h2>(4) TRIBUTE PAGE</h2>
        <p>
            July 2019 - This tribute page is one of the projects that I built as a part of the "Responsive Web Design Projects" course on www.freecodecamp.com. The video on this page is from my YouTube channel (Emuallim). I love creating white-board animation videos
            as much as coding.
        </p>
        <h2>(5) SERIOUS SURVEY</h2>
        <p>
            July 2019 - This survey is another project that I built as a part of the "Responsive Web Design Projects" course on www.freecodecamp.com. I tried my best to make it as fun as possible because I realised that coding is a pretty formal thing where missing
            single a comma might crash an entire website and humor makes coding more enjoyable, no matter the failures.
        </p>
        <h2>(6) APP LANDING PAGE</h2>
        <p>
            August 2019 - This is one of the projects that I built with the help of the "Practical Front-end Web Development - Learn With Projects" course. The page is fully responsive. It has a sticky header and animated elements
        </p>
        <h2>(7) DOCUMENTATION</h2>
        <p>
            September 2019 - Documentation another project that I built as a part of the "Responsive Web Design Projects" course on www.freecodecamp.com and I did b/c I wanted to have the curriculum for offline reference
        </p>
        <h2>(8) Blitz</h2>
        <p>
            October 2019 - I created Blitz as a part of Foundations of Front-End Web Development 2017 course and it is the very first website which I built fully. All the pages are included, not just the home page.
        </p>
        <h2>(9) WORDCAMP</h2>
        <p>
            November 2019 - To learn more about grid, I found a youtube video and built this website with the help of it. It is super responsive. I started to fall in love with CSS Grid
        </p>
        <h2>(16) HEX COLOR</h2>
        <p>
            April 2020 - After learning a lot about grid, I decided to learn more about javascript and found a website article titled "Build 100 Javascript Projects for Beginners" and I fell in love with the idea of learning by doing. "Hex Background Color" is the
            very first project I built using the resources in this article.
        </p>
        <h2>(17) RANDOM QUOTES</h2>
        <p>
            April 2020 - "Random Quotes" is the second javascript focused project that I built as a part of the "Build 100 Javascript Projects" challenge. JavaScript feels like magic to me because you can do really cool things with it.
        </p>
        <h2>(18) AGE MAGIC</h2>
        <p>
            April 2020 - I took the 3rd project called "Pass the Message" from "100 JavaScript Projects" challenge and put my own twist in it and turned it into "Age Magic".
        </p>
        <h2>(19) COUNTER</h2>
        <p>
            April 2020 - Counter is a very simple project from "100 JavaScript Projects" challenge. Even though its very simple, I still think its amazing to be able to give life to a webpage by writing a few lines of code.
        </p>
        <h2>(20) IMAGE SLIDER</h2>
        <p>
            April 2020 - I built the image slider by using the methods from the "counter" project. I added some of the most popular foods from Uzbek cuisine. It is mouth-watering isn't it?
        </p>
        <h2>(21) TESTIMONIALS</h2>
        <p>
            April 2020 - Testimonials is the project numero seven from the "Build 100 JavaScript Projects" challenge. I combined all the previously acquired knowledge to build this and added some animation to it as well

        <p>
            April 2020 - This is another project that I built recently. The idea comes from "100 JavaScript Projects"

            <p class="lead">
                Before moving into development, I worked as an English teacher almost for 9 years and <b>helped more than 600 students</b> get into top international universities in Uzbekistan and abroad. Since I like to challenge myself from time to
                time, I took the IELTS <i>(International English Language Testing System)</i> exam and got an overall band score of 8.0 out of 9.0 with a <b>perfect score of 9.0 in speaking</b> to join the top 2% of non-native English speakers of the
                world as a self-taught language learner.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                I canâ€™t wait to reach the same level of fluency in computer languages, especially in Javascript.
