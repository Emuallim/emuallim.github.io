			<header>Basic HTML and HTML5</header>
			<article>
				<p>
					HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is a markup language used to describe the structure of a web page. It uses a special syntax or notation to organize and give information about the page to the browser. Elements usually have opening and closing tags that surround and give meaning to content. For example, there are different tag options to place around text to show whether it is a heading, a paragraph, or a list.
				</p>
				<p>
					The HyperText part of HTML comes from the early days of the web and its original use case. Pages usually contained static documents that contained references to other documents. These references contained hypertext links used by the browser to navigate to the reference document so the user could read the reference document without having to manually search for it.
				</p>
				<p>
					As web pages and web applications grow more complex, the W3 Consortium updates the HTML specification to ensure that a webpage can be shown reliably on any browser. The latest version of HTML is HTML5.
				</p>
				<p>
					This section introduces how to use HTML elements to give structure and meaning to your web content.
				</p>

			</article>
		</section>


		<section class="main-section" id="Basic_CSS">
			<header>Basic CSS</header>
			<article>
				<p>
					Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) tell the browser how to display the text and other content that you write in HTML.
				</p>
				<p>
					Note that CSS is case-sensitive so be careful with your capitalization. CSS has been adopted by all major browsers and allows you to control:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>color</li>
					<li>fonts</li>
					<li>positioning</li>
					<li>spacing</li>
					<li>sizing</li>
					<li>decorations</li>
					<li>transitions</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					There are three main ways to apply CSS styling. You can apply inline styles directly to HTML elements with the style attribute. Alternatively, you can place CSS rules within style tags in an HTML document. Finally, you can write CSS rules in an external style sheet, then reference that file in the HTML document. Even though the first two options have their use cases, most developers prefer external style sheets because they keep the styles separate from the HTML elements. This improves the readability and reusability of your code. The idea behind CSS is that you can use a selector to target an HTML element in the DOM (Document Object Model) and then apply a variety of attributes to that element to change the way it is displayed on the page.
				</p>

		<section class="main-section" id="Visual_Design">
			<header>Visual Design</header>
			<article>
				<p>
					Visual Design in web development is a broad topic. It combines typography, color theory, graphics, animation, and page layout to help deliver a site's message. The definition of good design is a well-discussed subject, with many books on the theme.
				</p>
				<p>
					At a basic level, most web content provides a user with information. The visual design of the page can influence its presentation and a user's experience. In web development, HTML gives structure and semantics to a page's content, and CSS controls the layout and appearance of it.
				</p>
				<p>
					This section covers some of the basic tools developers use to create their own visual designs.
				</p>
			</article>

		<section class="main-section" id="Accessibility">
      <header>Accessibility</header>
<!--<header>The Applied Accessibility Challenges</header> -->
			<article>
				<p>
					"Accessibility" generally means having web content and a user interface that can be understood, navigated, and interacted with by a broad audience. This includes people with visual, auditory, mobility, or cognitive disabilities. Websites should be open and accessible to everyone, regardless of a user's abilities or resources. Some users rely on assistive technology such as a screen reader or voice recognition software. Other users may be able to navigate through a site only using a keyboard. Keeping the needs of various users in mind when developing your project can go a long way towards creating an open web. Here are three general concepts this section will explore throughout the following challenges:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>have well-organized code that uses appropriate markup</li>
					<li>ensure text alternatives exist for non-text and visual content</li>
					<li>create an easily-navigated page that's keyboard-friendly</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					Having accessible web content is an ongoing challenge. A great resource for your projects going forward is the W3 Consortium's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). They set the international standard for accessibility and provide a number of criteria you can use to check your work.

      <header>Web Design</header>
<!-- 			<header>The Responsive Web Design Challenges</header> -->
			<article>
				<p>
					Today, there are many types of devices that can access the web. They range from large desktop computers to small mobile phones. These devices have different screen sizes, resolutions, and processing power. Responsive Web Design is an approach to designing web content that responds to the constraints of different devices. The page structure and CSS rules should be flexible to accommodate these differences. In general, design the page's CSS to your target audience. If you expect most of your traffic to be from mobile users, take a 'mobile-first' approach. Then add conditional rules for larger screen sizes. If your visitors are desktop users, then design for larger screens with conditional rules for smaller sizes. CSS gives you the tools to write different style rules, then apply them depending on the device displaying the page. This section will cover the basic ways to use CSS for Responsive Web Design.
				</p>

		<section class="main-section" id="CSS_Flexbox">
      <header>CSS Flexbox</header>
<!-- 			<header>The CSS Flexbox Challenges</header> -->
			<article>
				<p>
					A website's User Interface ("UI") has two components. First, there are the visual elements, such as colors, fonts, and images. Second, there is the placement or positioning of those elements. In Responsive Web Design, a UI layout must accommodate many different browsers and devices accessing the content.
				</p>
				<p>
					CSS3 introduced Flexible Boxes, or flexbox, to create page layouts for a dynamic UI. It is a layout mode that arranges elements in a predictable way for different screen sizes and browsers. While somewhat new, all popular modern browsers support flexbox. This section covers how to use flexbox and the different layout options it offers.

		<section class="main-section" id="CSS_Grid">
      <header>CSS Grid</header>
<!-- 			<header>The CSS Grid Challenges</header> -->
			<article>
				<p>
					CSS Grid helps you easily build complex web designs. It works by turning an HTML element into a grid container with rows and columns for you to place children elements where you want within the grid.

					Time to put your newly learnt skills to work! By working on projects you would have the opportunity of applying all the skills, principles and concepts you have learnt so far HTML, CSS, Visual Design, Accessibility, etc.
				</p>
				<p>In this section you get the chance to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Build a Tribute Page</li>
					<li>Build a Survey Form</li>
					<li>Build a Product Landing Page</li>
					<li>Build a Technical Documentation Page</li>
					<li>Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					By the end of this, you would have 5 responsive websites under your belt that you can show off to friends, family, employers, etc. Have fun and remember to use the Read-Search-Ask method if you get stuck.

					Introduction to JavaScript
				</h2>
				<article>
					<p>
						JavaScript is a high-level programming language that all modern web browsers support. It is also one of the core technologies of the web, along with HTML and CSS that you may have learned previously. This section will cover basic JavaScript programming concepts, which range from variables and arithmetic to objects and loops.

			<section class="main-section" id="ES6_Challenges">
				<header>ES6 Challenges</header>
				<article>
					<p>
						ECMAScript is a standardized version of JavaScript with the goal of unifying the language's specifications and features. As all major browsers and JavaScript-runtimes follow this specification, the term ECMAScript is interchangeable with the term JavaScript.
					</p>
					<p>Most of the challenges on freeCodeCamp use the ECMAScript 5 (ES5) specification of the language, finalized in 2009. But JavaScript is an evolving programming language. As features are added and revisions are made, new versions of the language are released for use by developers.
					</p>
					<p>The most recent standardized version is called ECMAScript 6 (ES6), released in 2015. This new version of the language adds some powerful features that will be covered in this section of challenges, including:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Arrow functions</li>
						<li>Classes</li>
						<li>Modules</li>
						<li>Promises</li>
						<li>Generators</li>
						<li><code>let & const</code></li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						<strong>Note:</strong>
						Not all browsers support ES6 features. If you use ES6 in your own projects, you may need to use a program (transpiler) to convert your ES6 code into ES5 until browsers support ES6.

					<p>
						Regular expressions are special strings that represent a search pattern. Also known as "regex" or "regexp", they help programmers match, search, and replace text. Regular expressions can appear cryptic because a few characters have special meaning. The goal is to combine the symbols and text into a pattern that matches what you want, but only what you want. This section will cover the characters, a few shortcuts, and the common uses for writing regular expressions.

			<section class="main-section" id="Debugging">
        <header>Debugging</header>
<!-- 				<header>The Debugging Challenges</header> -->
				<article>
					<p>
						Debugging is a valuable and (unfortunately) necessary tool for programmers. It follows the testing phase of checking if your code works as intended, and discovering it does not. Debugging is the process of finding exactly what isn't working and fixing it. After spending time creating a brilliant block of code, it is tough realizing it may have errors. These issues generally come in three forms: 1) syntax errors that prevent a program from running, 2) runtime errors when code fails to execute or has unexpected behavior, and 3) semantic (or logical) errors when code doesn't do what it's meant to.
					</p>
					<p>
						Modern code editors (and experience) can help identify syntax errors. Semantic and runtime errors are harder to find. They may cause your program to crash, make it run forever, or give incorrect output. Think of debugging as trying to understand why your code is behaving the way it is.
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>
							Example of a syntax error - often detected by the code editor:
						</p>
						funtion willNotWork( {
						<br>
						console.log("Yuck");
						<br>
						}
						<br>
						// "function" keyword is misspelled and there's a missing parenthesis
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
							Here's an example of a runtime error - often detected while the program executes:
						<br>
						<br>

						function loopy() {
						<br>
						while(true) {
						<br>
						console.log("Hello, world!");
							<br>
							}
						<br>
						}
						<br>
						// Calling loopy starts an infinite loop, which may crash your browser
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						Example of a semantic error - often detected after testing code output:
						<br><br>

						function calcAreaOfRect(w, h) {
						<br>
						return w + h; // This should be w * h
						<br>
						}
						<br>
						let myRectArea = calcAreaOfRect(2, 3);
						<br>
						// Correct syntax and the program executes, but this gives the wrong answer
					</blockquote>
					<p>
						Debugging is frustrating, but it helps to develop (and follow) a step-by-step approach to review your code. This means checking the intermediate values and types of variables to see if they are what they should be. You can start with a simple process of elimination.
					</p>
					<p>
						For example, if function A works and returns what it's supposed to, then function B may have the issue. Or start checking values in a block of code from the middle to try to cut the search space in half. A problem in one spot indicates a bug in the first half of the code. If not, it's likely in the second.
					</p>
					<p>
						This section will cover a couple helpful tools to find bugs, and some of the common forms they take. Fortunately, debugging is a learnable skill that just requires a little patience and practice to master.

					<p>
						To make solving problems easier, it can be helpful to break them down into many chunks. Then, each chunk can be solved one by one. For example, if you are building a calculator, don't try to solve the problem as a whole. First, consider how to get inputs. Then, determine each arithmetic operation one by one. Finally, display the results.
					</p>
					<p>
						In this section we will learn to solve basic algorithm problems using JavaScript. This will help you improve your problem solving skills and prepare you to later solve more complex problems.

						<strong>Hint: </strong>If you get stuck, try using console.log()to log variable values to the console. This will help to debug problems.

<!-- 				<header>The Object Oriented Programming Challenges</header> -->
				<article>
					<p>
						At its core, software development solves a problem or achieves a result with computation. The software development process first defines a problem, then presents a solution. Object oriented programming is one of several major approaches to the software development process.
					</p>
					<p>
						As its name implies, object oriented programming organizes code into object definitions. These are sometimes called classes, and they group together data with related behavior. The data is an object's attributes, and the behavior (or functions) are methods.
					</p>
					<p>
						The object structure makes it flexible within a program. Objects can transfer information by calling and passing data to another object's methods. Also, new classes can receive, or inherit, all the features from a base or parent class. This helps to reduce repeated code.
					</p>
					<p>
						Your choice of programming approach depends on a few factors. These include the type of problem, as well as how you want to structure your data and algorithms. This section covers object oriented programming principles in JavaScript.

				<article>
					<p>
						Functional programming is an approach to software development based around the evaluation of functions. Like mathematics, functions in programming map input to output to produce a result. You can combine basic functions in many ways to build more and more complex programs.
					</p>
					<p>
						Functional programming follows a few core principles:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Functions are independent from the state of the program or global variables. They only depend on the arguments passed into them to make a calculation
						</li>
						<li>
							Functions try to limit any changes to the state of the program and avoid changes to the global objects holding data
						</li>
						<li>
							Functions have minimal side effects in the program
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						The functional programming software development approach breaks a program into small, testable parts. This section covers basic functional programming principles in JavaScript.

					<p>
						Sass, or "Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets", is a language extension of CSS. It adds features that aren't available using basic CSS syntax. Sass makes it easier for developers to simplify and maintain the style sheets for their projects.
					</p>
					<p>
						Sass can extend the CSS language because it is a preprocessor. It takes code written using Sass syntax, and converts it into basic CSS. This allows you to create variables, nest CSS rules into others, and import other Sass files, among other things. The result is more compact, easier to read code.
					</p>
					<p>
						There are two syntaxes available for Sass. The first, known as SCSS (Sassy CSS) and used throughout these challenges, is an extension of the syntax of CSS. This means that every valid CSS stylesheet is a valid SCSS file with the same meaning. Files using this syntax have the .scss extension.
					</p>
					<p>
						The second and older syntax, known as the indented syntax (or sometimes just "Sass"), uses indentation rather than brackets to indicate nesting of selectors, and newlines rather than semicolons to separate properties. Files using this syntax have the .sass extension.

					<li><strong>User Story #1:</strong> I can see a <code>textarea</code> element with a corresponding <code>id="editor"</code>.</li>

					<li><strong>User Story #2:</strong> I can see an element with a corresponding <code>id="preview"</code>.</li>
					
					<li><strong>User Story #3:</strong> When I enter text into the <code>#editor</code> element, the <code>#preview</code> element is updated as I type to display the content of the textarea.</li>
					
					<li><strong>User Story #4:</strong> When I enter GitHub flavored markdown into the <code>#editor</code> element, the text is rendered as HTML in the <code>#preview</code> element as I type (HINT: You don't need to parse Markdown yourself - you can import the Marked library for this: <a href="https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked">https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked</a>).</li>
					
					<li><strong>User Story #5:</strong> When my markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the <code>#editor</code> field should contain valid markdown that represents at least one of each of the following elements: a header (H1 size), a sub header (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text.</li>

					<li><strong>User Story #6:</strong> When my markdown previewer first loads, the default markdown in the <code>#editor</code> field should be rendered as HTML in the <code>#preview</code> element.</li>

					<li><strong>Optional Bonus (you do not need to make this test pass):</strong> When I click a link rendered by my markdown previewer, the link is opened up in a new tab (HINT: read the Marked.js docs for this one!).</li>

					<li><strong>Optional Bonus (you do not need to make this test pass):</strong> My markdown previewer interprets carriage returns and renders them as br(line break) elements.</li>

					<li><strong>User Story #1:</strong> My calculator should contain a clickable element containing an =(equal sign) with a corresponding <code>id="equals"</code>.</li>

					<li><strong>User Story #2:</strong> My calculator should contain 10 clickable elements containing one number each from 0-9, with the following corresponding IDs: <code>id="zero", id="one", id="two", id="three", id="four", id="five", id="six", id="seven", id="eight"</code>, and <code>id="nine"</code>.</li>
					
					<li><strong>User Story #3:</strong> My calculator should contain 4 clickable elements each containing one of the 4 primary mathematical operators with the following corresponding IDs: <code>id="add", id="subtract", id="multiply", id="divide"</code>.</li>
					
					<li><strong>User Story #4:</strong> My calculator should contain a clickable element containing a .(decimal point) symbol with a corresponding <code>id="decimal"</code>.</li>
					
					<li><strong>User Story #5:</strong>My calculator should contain a clickable element with an <code>id="clear"</code>.</li>

					<li><strong>User Story #6:</strong> My calculator should contain an element to display values with a corresponding <code>id="display"</code>.</li>

					<li><strong>User Story #7:</strong> At any time, pressing the clear button clears the input and output values, and returns the calculator to its initialized state; 0 should be shown in the element with the id of <code>display</code>.</li>

					<li><strong>User Story #8:</strong> As I input numbers, I should be able to see my input in the element with the id of <code>display</code>.</li>

					<li><strong>User Story #9:</strong> In any order, I should be able to add, subtract, multiply and divide a chain of numbers of any length, and when I hit =, the correct result should be shown in the element with the id of <code>display</code>.</li>

					<li><strong>User Story #10:</strong>When inputting numbers, my calculator should not allow a number to begin with multiple zeros.</li>

					<li><strong>User Story #11:</strong>When the decimal element is clicked, a .should append to the currently displayed value; two .in one number should not be accepted.</li>

					<li><strong>User Story #12:</strong>I should be able to perform any operation (+, -, *, /) on numbers containing decimal points.</li>

					<li><strong>User Story #13:</strong> If 2 or more operators are entered consecutively, the operation performed should be the last operator entered.</li>

					<li><strong>User Story #14:</strong>Pressing an operator immediately following =should start a new calculation that operates on the result of the previous evaluation.</li>

					<li><strong>User Story #15:</strong>My calculator should have several decimal places of precision when it comes to rounding (note that there is no exact standard, but you should be able to handle calculations like 2 / 7with reasonable precision to at least 4 decimal places).</li>

					<li><strong>Note On Calculator Logic: </strong>It should be noted that there are two main schools of thought on calculator input logic: immediate execution logic and formula logic. Our example utilizes formula logic and observes order of operation precedence, immediate execution does not. Either is acceptable, but please note that depending on which you choose, your calculator may yield different results than ours for certain equations (see below example). As long as your math can be verified by another production calculator, please do not consider this a bug.</li>

					<p><strong>EXAMPLE: </strong><code> 3 + 5 x 6 - 2 / 4 =</code>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>
									Immediate Execution Logic:
								</strong>
								<code>11.5</code>
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>
									Formula/Expression Logic: 
								</strong>
								<code>32.5</code>
